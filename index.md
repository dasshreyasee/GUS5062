# Welcome

Welcome to my GIS portfolio for Temple University's Fundamentals of GIS (GUS 5062). This site highlights selected GIS projects where I applied spatial analysis techniques to questions in environmental justice, urban infrastructure, and public health.

Each project includes a map, a short narrative describing the spatial problem explored, and a summary of GIS tools used. These projects demonstrate skills in buffer analysis, spatial joins, suitability modeling, multi-criteria evaluation, and geoprocessing workflows. 


## About Me

I’m an Instructional Associate Professor at Temple University, Philadelphia. I joined the Economics Department in 2018. I earned my Ph.D., M.A., and B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Houston. Before Temple, I was as an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. 

My research interests are in in gender economics, household economics, and development economics. Some of my current research the role natural and industrial disasters play in household formation and marital matching outcomes, the impact of women's property rights and political participation on their empowerment, water allocation rules on health and agricultural productivity, and most recently, the relationship between electrification and intimate partner violence. 

I teach a variety of first-year and upper-level courses at Temple. Recently, I've been dabbling in research on how to teach economics better.

## Projects for GUS 5062

Here are some of my favorite projects we did in the Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems. I was particularly drawn to these projects because they highlight a core economic concept that is deeply relevant to environmental science: externalities, both positive and negative. Collectively, these projects explore topics ranging from environmental hazards to disparities in access to clean water and healthy foods.
