# Welcome

 Welcome to my GIS portfolio for Temple University's Fundamentals of GIS (GUS 5062). This site highlights selected GIS projects where I applied spatial analysis techniques to questions in environmental justice, urban infrastructure, and public health.

Each project includes a map, a short narrative describing the spatial problem explored, and a summary of GIS tools used. These projects demonstrate skills in buffer analysis, spatial joins, suitability modeling, multi-criteria evaluation, and geoprocessing workflows.
