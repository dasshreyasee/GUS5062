# Projects from GUS 5062

Below is a selection of GIS projects I completed for Temple University's  
**Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GUS 5062)**.  
These projects explore spatial data through the lens of environmental justice,  
public health, and urban infrastructure—topics that connect naturally  
to economic concepts such as externalities and spillover effects.
