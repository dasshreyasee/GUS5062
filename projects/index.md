# Projects from GUS 5062

Below is a selection of GIS projects I completed for Temple University's Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GUS 5062). I was particularly drawn to these projects because they highlight a core economic concept that is deeply relevant to environmental science: externalities, both positive and negative. Collectively, these projects explore topics ranging from environmental hazards to disparities in access to clean water and nutrition.
